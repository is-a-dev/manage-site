### Using your domain
**For server owners**:
If your domain points to a server you own, add your-domain.is-a.dev to your domain configuration. For HTTPS, you will have to configure an SSL certificate to allow the new subdomain to work ([here's why](https://domains.google/intl/en_au/tld/dev/#:~:text=Every%20.dev%20domain%20is%20on%20the%20HSTS%20preload%20list%2C%20which%20makes%20HTTPS%20required%20on%20all%20connections.%20That%20means%20built%2Din%20security%20for%20you%20and%20your%20customers.)).

**For GitHub Pages users**:
- Go to your GitHub repository that you use for your is-a.dev domain
- Click the Settings tab
- Click on the Pages link in the sidebar
- In the custom domain option, enter the domain you registered.
- Check the Enforce HTTPS checkbox below the input (you'll need to wait for your pull request to be merged for this)
- Give your domain some time (~24 hours) for the changes to propagate
- Enjoy your domain!

**Need help with your domain?** If you are having trouble setting up your domain, please [create an issue](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register/issues/new/choose), and we will try our best to get back to you as soon as possible!
